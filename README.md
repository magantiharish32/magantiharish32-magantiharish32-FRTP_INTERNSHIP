- **_Azure DevOps_**
  - Integration with Azure DevOps & Application Source Code is an important big part of the ALM (Application Life-cycle Management) and it would be awesome to automate the      unpacking/packing process as opposed to doing it manually
  
Application Details :
- The OFFICIAL **_URL_** of the application
  - https://apps.powerapps.com/play/cba002b2-7fcc-4a02-807c-cc5edc751ca7?tenantId=c5ef186e-1ed0-4e0b-8b12-df22547dc0b7
    
  **NOTE** : The application is designed and developed on the Microsoft Power Platform
    - To run the app, the user needs to download the Windows or Android version of **_Power Apps Official Software by Microsoft_**. 
    - The other way is to **_sign in_** at the Power Apps portal in the web browser. But, due to the limitations of the _Power Platform_, the app can be run only by the members of the organization that the app is shared with. To run the application by the external users, it is must to share the data connections of the app including credentials with the users, which is not possible due to the privacy issues.
    
    So, on the demand of the FRT Mentors, below are the _Demo_ vedios of the app -
